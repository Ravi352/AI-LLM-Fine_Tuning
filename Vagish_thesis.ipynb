              "'Based on the provided context, this document appears to be a report or study that investigates the ballistic performance of a projectile made of aluminium. The document describes the geometry and composition of the projectile and discusses the use of an O-ring sealing to reduce friction and gas leakage during firing.\\n\\nThe study measures the pre-impact and post-impact velocities of the projectile using a high-speed camera. The impact velocity is controlled by adjusting the compressor pressure and using overhead projector sheets and butter paper sheets. Ballistic tests are conducted on panels made of UD-UHMWP (unidirectional ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) with varying numbers of layers.\\n\\nThe target panels are placed in a pendulum fixture and impacted by the projectile. The study measures the energy absorption, ballistic limit, and back face signature of the panels. Multiple tests are conducted for each velocity to account for measurement variability, and average values with standard deviation are determined.\\n\\nThe document mentions that the STF (shear thickening fluid) impregnated panel shows enhanced energy absorption compared to the non-perforated panel. The secondary fibers in the treated sample are pushed aside and experience fiber breakage, resulting in the dissipation of energy over a larger area. The increased friction between the layers and the surface of the projectile and UD-UHMWP fabric layers contribute to the improved energy absorption.\\n\\nThe back face signature, or back face deformation, of the non-perforated panel is also evaluated as a measure of ballistic performance.\\n\\nOverall, the document focuses on the ballistic performance of the aluminium projectile and the impact of using STF impregnated UD-UHMWP panels.'"
